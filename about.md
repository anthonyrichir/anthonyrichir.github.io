My name is Anthony Richir and I’ve been developing with Java since 2008.

Through those years, I’ve been working with in several industries, mainly banking, payroll management, public and medical sectors, as well as technologies such as Spring and Hibernate.

Nowadays, I’m working at [Altissia][altissia], a Belgian company specialized in language training, whose teaching method is built around an e-learning platform.

Recently, I’ve been willing to start this blog to share my experience, to think about new ideas and, I hope, to exchange with others.
